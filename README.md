# Overview 

ATLytiCS provides Atlanta-based nonprofits with analytics and insights to help fund humanitarian initiatives within our community. We help skilled professionals give back to their communities, working with data modeling to assist other nonprofits and government agency initiatives.

Our vision is a connected analytics community, conscientious of its role in society and aware that humanityâ€™s well-being should be at the core of our technological progress. We aspire to help build a world powered by data and analytics to provide others access to basic human rights so that we all have a choice in shaping our individual and collective future.
